# Password-Generator-HW-3

This website is a 8-128 password generator that will randomly generate a password for the user by pressing the 'generate password' button.

While looking through the html/js/css you will see a fully put together password generator that will prompt the user if they want to use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, or numbers. they can say (y/n) to each one but have to at least choose one.
